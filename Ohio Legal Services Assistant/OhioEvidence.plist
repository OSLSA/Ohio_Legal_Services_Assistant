		<string>1&lt;b&gt;RULE 102. Purpose and Construction&lt;/b&gt;</string>
		<string>1The purpose of these rules is to provide procedures for the adjudication of causes to the end that the truth may be ascertained and proceedings justly determined. The principles of the common law of Ohio shall supplement the provisions of these rules, and the rules shall be construed to state the principles of the common law of Ohio unless the rule clearly indicates that a change is intended. These rules shall not supersede substantive statutory provisions.</string>

	<array>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;RULE 103. Rulings on Evidence&lt;/b&gt;</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(A) Effect of erroneous ruling&lt;/b&gt; Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected, and</string>
		<string>2&lt;b&gt;(1) Objection.&lt;/b&gt; In case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the context; or</string>
		<string>2&lt;b&gt;(2) Offer of proof.&lt;/b&gt; In case the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked. Offer of proof is not necessary if evidence is excluded during crossexamination.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(B) Record of offer and ruling.&lt;/b&gt; At the time of making the ruling, the court may add any other or further statement which shows the character of the evidence, the form in which it was offered, the objection made, and the ruling thereon. It may direct the making of an offer in question and answer form.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(C) Hearing of jury.&lt;/b&gt; In jury cases, proceedings shall be conducted, to the extent practicable, so as to prevent inadmissible evidence from being suggested to the jury by any means, such as making statements or offers of proof or asking questions in the hearing of the jury.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(D) Plain error.&lt;/b&gt; Nothing in this rule precludes taking notice of plain errors affecting substantial rights although they were not brought to the attention of the court.</string>

		<string>1&lt;b&gt;RULE 104. Preliminary Questions&lt;/b&gt;</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(A) Questions of admissibility generally.&lt;/b&gt; Preliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness, the existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court, subject to the provisions of subdivision (B). In making its determination it is not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect to privileges.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(B) Relevancy conditioned on fact.&lt;/b&gt; When the relevancy of evidence depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court shall admit it upon, or subject to, the introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding of the fulfillment of the condition.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(C) Hearing of jury.&lt;/b&gt; Hearings on the admissibility of confessions shall in all cases be conducted out of the hearing of the jury. Hearings on other preliminary matters shall also be conducted out of the hearing of the jury when the interests of justice require.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(D) Testimony by accused.&lt;/b&gt; The accused does not, by testifying upon a preliminary matter, become subject to cross-examination as to other issues in the case.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(E) Weight and credibility.&lt;/b&gt; This rule does not limit the right of a party to introduce before the jury evidence relevant to weight or credibility.</string>

		<string>1&lt;b&gt;RULE 201. Judicial Notice of Adjudicative Facts&lt;/b&gt;</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(A) Scope of rule.&lt;/b&gt; This rule governs only judicial notice of adjudicative facts; i.e., the facts of the case.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(B) Kinds of facts.&lt;/b&gt; A judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(C) When discretionary.&lt;/b&gt; A court may take judicial notice, whether requested or not.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(D) When mandatory.&lt;/b&gt; A court shall take judicial notice if requested by a party and supplied with the necessary information.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(E) Opportunity to be heard.&lt;/b&gt; A party is entitled upon timely request to an opportunity to be heard as to the propriety of taking judicial notice and the tenor of the matter noticed. In the absence of prior notification, the request may be made after judicial notice has been taken.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(F) Time of taking notice.&lt;/b&gt; Judicial notice may be taken at any stage of the proceeding.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(G) Instructing jury.&lt;/b&gt; In a civil action or proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury to accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed. In a criminal case, the court shall instruct the jury that it may, but is not required to, accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed.</string>

		<string>1&lt;b&gt;RULE 301. Presumptions in General in Civil Actions and Proceedings&lt;/b&gt;</string>
		<string>1In all civil actions and proceedings not otherwise provided for by statute enacted by the General Assembly or by these rules, a presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption, but does not shift to such party the burden of proof in the sense of the risk of non-persuasion, which remains throughout the trial upon the party on whom it was originally cast.</string>

		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(A) Exclusion mandatory.&lt;/b&gt; Although relevant, evidence is not admissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(B) Exclusion discretionary.&lt;/b&gt; Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by considerations of undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</string>

		<string>2&lt;b&gt;(1) Character of accused.&lt;/b&gt; Evidence of a pertinent trait of character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same is admissible; however, in prosecutions for rape, gross sexual imposition, and prostitution, the exceptions provided by statute enacted by the General Assembly are applicable.</string>

		<string>2&lt;b&gt;(3) Character of witness.&lt;/b&gt; Evidence of the character of a witness on the issue of credibility is admissible as provided in Rules 607, 608, and 609.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(B) Other crimes, wrongs or acts.&lt;/b&gt; Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.

In criminal cases, the proponent of evidence to be offered under this rule shall provide reasonable notice in advance of trial, or during trial if the court excuses pretrial notice on good cause shown, of the general nature of any such evidence it intends to introduce at trial.</string>

Evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations is likewise not admissible. This rule does not require the exclusion of any evidence otherwise discoverable merely because it is presented in the course of compromise negotiations. This rule also does not require exclusion when the evidence is offered for another purpose, such as proving bias or prejudice of a witness, negativing a contention of undue delay, or proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.</string>

		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(A) Opinion and reputation evidence of character.&lt;/b&gt; The credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by evidence in the form of opinion or reputation, but subject to these limitations: (1) the evidence may refer only to character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, and (2) evidence of truthful character is admissible only after the character of the witness for truthfulness has been attacked by opinion or reputation evidence or otherwise.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(B) Specific instances of conduct.&lt;/b&gt; Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness&apos;s character for truthfulness, other than conviction of crime as provided in Evid.

They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if clearly probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness (1) concerning the witness&apos;s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or (2) concerning the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as to which character the witness being cross-examined has testified.</string>

		<string>1&lt;b&gt;RULE 609. Impeachment by Evidence of Conviction of Crime&lt;/b&gt;</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(A) General rule.&lt;/b&gt; For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness:</string>
		<string>2(1) subject to Evid.R. 403, evidence that a witness other than the accused has been convicted of a crime is admissible if the crime was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year pursuant to the law under which the witness was convicted.</string>
		<string>2(2) notwithstanding Evid.R. 403(A), but subject to Evid.R. 403(B), evidence that the accused has been convicted of a crime is admissible if the crime was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year pursuant to the law under which the accused was convicted and if the court determines that the probative value of the evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.</string>
		<string>2(3) notwithstanding Evid.R. 403(A), but subject to Evid.R. 403(B), evidence that any witness, including an accused, has been convicted of a crime is admissible if the crime involved dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment and whether based upon state or federal statute or local ordinance.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(B) Time limit.&lt;/b&gt; Evidence of a conviction under this rule is not admissible if a period of more than ten years has elapsed since the date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from the confinement, or the termination of community control sanctions, post-release control, or probation, shock probation, parole, or shock parole imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later date, unless the court determines, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect. However, evidence of a conviction more than ten years old as calculated herein, is not admissible unless the proponent gives to the adverse party sufficient advance written notice of intent to use such evidence to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to contest the use of such evidence.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(C) Effect of pardon, annulment, expungement, or certificate of rehabilitation.&lt;/b&gt; Evidence of a conviction is not admissible under this rule if (1) the conviction has been the subject of a pardon, annulment, expungement, certificate of rehabilitation, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding of the rehabilitation of the person convicted, and that person has not been convicted of a subsequent crime which was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year, or (2) the conviction has been the subject of a pardon, annulment, expungement, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding of innocence.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(D) Juvenile adjudications.&lt;/b&gt; Evidence of juvenile adjudications is not admissible except as provided by statute enacted by the General Assembly.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(E) Pendency of appeal.&lt;/b&gt; The pendency of an appeal therefrom does not render evidence of a conviction inadmissible. Evidence of the pendency of an appeal is admissible.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(F) Methods of proof.&lt;/b&gt; When evidence of a witness&apos;s conviction of a crime is admissible under this rule, the fact of the conviction may be proved only by the testimony of the witness on direct or cross-examination, or by public record shown to the witness during his or her examination. If the witness denies that he or she is the person to whom the public record refers, the court may permit the introduction of additional evidence tending to establish that the witness is or is not the person to whom the public record refers.</string>

Any portion withheld over objections shall be preserved and made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal. If a writing is not produced or delivered pursuant to order under this rule, the court shall make any order justice requires, except that in criminal cases when the prosecution elects not to comply, the order shall be one striking the testimony or, if the court in its discretion determines that the interests of justice so require, declaring a mistrial.</string>

		<string>1&lt;b&gt;RULE 804 Hearsay Exceptions; Declarant Unavailable&lt;/b&gt;</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(A) Definition of unavailability.&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Unavailability as a witness&quot; includes any of the following situations in which the declarant:</string>
		<string>2(1) is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of the declarant&apos;s statement;</string>
		<string>2(2) persists in refusing to testify concerning the subject matter of the declarant&apos;s statement despite an order of the court to do so;</string>
		<string>2(3) testifies to a lack of memory of the subject matter of the declarant&apos;s statement;</string>
		<string>2(4) is unable to be present or to testify at the hearing because of death or then-existing physical or mental illness or infirmity;</string>
		<string>2(5) is absent from the hearing and the proponent of the declarant&apos;s statement has been unable to procure the declarant&apos;s attendance (or in the case of a hearsay exception under division (B)(2), (3), or (4) of this rule, the declarant&apos;s attendance or testimony) by process or other reasonable means.</string>
		<string>1A declarant is not unavailable as a witness if the declarant&apos;s exemption, refusal, claim of lack of memory, inability, or absence is due to the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of the declarant&apos;s statement for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying.</string>
		<string>1&lt;b&gt;(B) Hearsay exceptions.&lt;/b&gt; The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:</string>
		<string>2&lt;b&gt;(1) Former testimony.&lt;/b&gt; Testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of the same or another proceeding, if the party against whom the testimony is now offered, or, in a civil action or proceeding, a predecessor in interest, had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination. Testimony given at a preliminary hearing must satisfy the right to confrontation and exhibit indicia of reliability.</string>
		<string>2&lt;b&gt;(2) Statement under belief of impending death.&lt;/b&gt; In a prosecution for homicide or in a civil action or proceeding, a statement made by a declarant, while believing that his or her death was imminent, concerning the cause or circumstances of what the declarant believed to be his or her impending death.</string>
		<string>2&lt;b&gt;(3) Statement against interest.&lt;/b&gt; A statement that was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant&apos;s pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the declarant against another, that a reasonable person in the declarant&apos;s position would not have made the statement unless the declarant believed it to be true. A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability, whether offered to exculpate or inculpate the accused, is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the truthworthiness of the statement.</string>
		<string>2&lt;b&gt;(4) Statement of personal or family history.&lt;/b&gt; (a) A statement concerning the declarant&apos;s own birth, adoption, marriage, divorce, legitimacy, relationship by blood, adoption, or marriage, ancestry, or other similar fact of personal or family history, even though the declarant had no means of acquiring personal knowledge of the matter stated; or (b) a statement concerning the foregoing matters, and death also, of another person, if the declarant was related to the other by blood, adoption, or marriage or was so intimately associated with the other&apos;s family as to be likely to have accurate information concerning the matter declared.</string>
		<string>2&lt;b&gt;(5) Statement by a deceased or incompetent person.&lt;/b&gt; The statement was made by a decedent or a mentally incompetent person, where all of the following apply:</string>
		<string>3(a) the estate or personal representative of the decedent&apos;s estate or the guardian or trustee of the incompetent person is a party;</string>
		<string>3(b) the statement was made before the death or the development of the incompetency;</string>
		<string>3(c) the statement is offered to rebut testimony by an adverse party on a matter within the knowledge of the decedent or incompetent person.</string>
		<string>2&lt;b&gt;(6) Forfeiture by wrongdoing.&lt;/b&gt; A statement offered against a party if the unavailability of the witness is due to the wrongdoing of the party for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying. However, a statement is not admissible under this rule unless the proponent has given to each adverse party advance written notice of an intention to introduce the statement sufficient to provide the adverse party a fair opportunity to contest the admissibility of the statement.</string>

		<string>1(A) When a hearsay statement, or a statement defined in Evid.R. 801(D)(2), (c), (d), or (e), has been admitted in evidence, the credibility of the declarant may be attacked, and if attacked may be supported, by any evidence that would be admissible for those purposes if declarant had testified as a witness.</string>

		<string>1&lt;b&gt;RULE 807. Hearsay Exceptions; Child Statements in Abuse Cases&lt;/b&gt;</string>
		<string>1(A) An out-of-court statement made by a child who is under twelve years of age at the time of trial or hearing describing any sexual act performed by, with, or on the child or describing any act of physical violence directed against the child is not excluded as hearsay under Evid.R. 802 if all of the following apply:</string>
		<string>2(1) The court finds that the totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement provides particularized guarantees of trustworthiness that make the statement at least as reliable as statements admitted pursuant to Evid.R. 803 and 804. The circumstances must establish that the child was particularly likely to be telling the truth when the statement was made and that the test of cross-examination would add little to the reliability of the statement. In making its determination of the reliability of the statement, the court shall consider all of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement, including but not limited to spontaneity, the internal consistency of the statement, the mental state of the child, the child&apos;s motive or lack of motive to fabricate, the child&apos;s use of terminology unexpected of a child of similar age, the means by which the statement was elicited, and the lapse of time between the act and the statement. In making this determination, the court shall not consider whether there is independent proof of the sexual act or act of physical violence.</string>
		<string>2(2) The child&apos;s testimony is not reasonably obtainable by the proponent of the statement.</string>
		<string>2(3) There is independent proof of the sexual act or act of physical violence.</string>
		<string>2(4) At least ten days before the trial or hearing, a proponent of the statement has notified all other parties in writing of the content of the statement, the time and place at which the statement was made, the identity of the witness who is to testify about the statement, and the circumstances surrounding the statement that are claimed to indicate its trustworthiness.</string>
		<string>1(B) The child&apos;s testimony is &quot;not reasonably obtainable by the proponent of the statement&quot; under division (A)(2) of this rule only if one or more of the following apply:</string>
		<string>2(1) The child refuses to testify concerning the subject matter of the statement or claims a lack of memory of the subject matter of the statement after a person trusted by the child, in the presence of the court, urges the child to both describe the acts described by the statement and to testify.</string>
		<string>2(2) The court finds all of the following:</string>
		<string>3(a) the child is absent from the trial or hearing;</string>
		<string>3(b) the proponent of the statement has been unable to procure the child&apos;s attendance or testimony by process or other reasonable means despite a good faith effort to do so;(c) it is probable that the proponent would be unable to procure the child&apos;s testimony or attendance if the trial or hearing were delayed for a reasonable time.</string>
		<string>2(3) The court finds both of the following:</string>
		<string>3(a) the child is unable to testify at the trial or hearing because of death or then existing physical or mental illness or infirmity;</string>
		<string>3(b) the illness or infirmity would not improve sufficiently to permit the child to testify if the trial or hearing were delayed for a reasonable time.</string>
		<string>2The proponent of the statement has not established that the child&apos;s testimony or attendance is not reasonably obtainable if the child&apos;s refusal, claim of lack of memory, inability, or absence is due to the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of the statement for the purpose of preventing the child from attending or testifying.</string>
		<string>1(C) The court shall make the findings required by this rule on the basis of a hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury and shall make findings of fact, on the record, as to the bases for its ruling.</string>
