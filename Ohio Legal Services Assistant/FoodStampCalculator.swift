To determine the AG's total gross income, add the gross monthly income earned by all AG members and the total monthly unearned income of all AG members, minus income exclusions. If an AG has income from a farming operation (with gross proceeds of more than one thousand dollars per year) which operates at a loss, see rule 5101:4-6-11 of the Administrative Code. The total gross income is compared to the gross income eligibility standard for the appropriate AG size. If the total gross income is less than the standard, proceed with calculating the adjusted net income as described in paragraph (S) of this rule. If the total gross income is more than the standard, the AG is ineligible for program benefits and the case is either denied or terminated at this point. */
